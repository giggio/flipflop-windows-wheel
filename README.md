# flipflop-windows-wheel

This is a C# .NET 8 application which controls the 'flipflopwheel' option in Windows, which allows you to specify how scrolling behavior works in Windows.  Normally, sliding your finger down on a trackpad or scrollwheel will move the scrollbar down on a page.  This setting reverses that behavior. 

Binary is [in releases](../../releases).

Forked from https://github.com/jamie-pate/flipflop-windows-wheel/

NOTE: *Tested in Windows 11*
